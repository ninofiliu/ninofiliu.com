_Aggregate_ is an innovative art game that explores the concept of artificial intelligence learning to desire. Set in a vast, desolate landscape filled with electrical pylons, abandonned supermarkets, and post-sovietic superstructures, players take turns controlling a humanoid personnification of an AI as it painfully navigates through this wasteland.

The main game loop consists in the player having to walk long distances across thorn-ridden fields that quickly make them die out, but on respawn the paths traversed in previous lives are now safe to walk without losing health points. Across many iterations, the adversarial landscape slowly morphs into a network of walkable highway.

There is a striking parallel between this game mechanic and and the way machine learning models learn concepts, namely through many iterations of exploring a tiny area around where they "are" and moving slightly in a newly known direction of optimization.

The resin 3D printed gamepad displays a large array of thorns and spikes: designed to be uncomfortable to hold, its use creates a tangible connection between the player and the AI's struggles.

The project aims to provoke thought about the nature of desire, the role of AI in understanding human experiences, and the concept of "third landscape" - spaces that exist outside of traditional urban planning. It challenges players to reconsider abandoned spaces, the contingency of desire, and the subjectivity of algorithms in our contemporary world.

I took the technical lead of the project around halfway through, when we realised that a completely flat collaboration paradigm wasn't working well.

Powered by Unity, the game doesn't use that many pre-made assets and is mostly composed of bespoke 3D models, scripts and music. We all made technical progress while working on the game, as the project made us either reuse or learn concepts in C#, visual scripting, shaders, cinematics, level design, 3D modelisation, optimization, non-linear game narration, and more.

As a large open world built by people from wildly different background, it was both a technical and managerial challenge to pull off, but the game was ready with zero reported blocking bugs for its release at Octobre Numérique 2024. The game is currently shown on festival and galleries and is not yet available for all to play, but if you're interested in playtesting it, don't hesitate to contact me and ask for a build.

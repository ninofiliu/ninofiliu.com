_« My off the shelf AI sex dolls pussy has sensors in it so when fucked with a long object it audibly "comes". Here it is doing the act with another equally inanimate object. I am so happy to finally have this produced since it been on my mind for a while. I think it is both cute and tender and it also says a lot about our ideas of pleasure which gets highlighted when taking out the human part of this usually object to human interaction. A huuuuge thanks to Nino Filiu who produced this and delt with the robotic and software parts of this beauty, such a smooth and nice production. »_ - [Arvida Byström](https://www.instagram.com/p/DJ9AYEbN0SS/)

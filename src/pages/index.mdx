# Hi, I'm Nino Filiu

I create digital experiences through the use of technology

This can manifest in many forms but basically I know how to

- write programs that process & generate videos, images, and sounds
- engineer interactive digital installations
- code full stack web applications
- create video games
- +1000s unrelated skills (music producing, tattooing, quantum physics knowledge, photography, etc)

& I'm open for work involving using these tech skills for creative purposes

- [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/nino.filiu/): generative art, 3d renders, photography, random
- [Twitter](https://twitter.com/ninofiliu): generative art, web dev research
- [Github](https://github.com/ninofiliu): open source projects

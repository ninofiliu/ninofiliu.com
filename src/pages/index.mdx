# Hi, I'm Nino Filiu

I am a tech artist exploring novel digital experiences enabled by emerging technologies.

What if a sculpture got scared when you got too close? How does it feels to control a video game with DJ hardware? What do the bioelectricity of plants sound like? Can the web be used as a medium for interactive narratives? How do NPCs feel when you delete their game from your computer?

I spent the past few years asking questions like these in the shape of video games, interactive art, visual art, and more; either as solo works or as collective works with [Distraction](https://distraction.fun/).
